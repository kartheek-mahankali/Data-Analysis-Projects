# Temperature Change around the world
Global Warming is the increase of average world temperatures as a result of what is known as the greenhouse effect.
The potential future effects of global climate change include more frequent wildfires, longer periods of drought in some regions and an increase in the number, duration and intensity of tropical storms.
In this case study, we will be exploring how the average temperature changed over the years across 192 countries and 38 territories and this data is covered from 1961 to 2019.

## Source
Data are based on the publicly availabe GISTEMP data, the Global Surface Temperature Change data distributed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Institute for Space Studies(NASA-GISS)

## Exploration and Regression Anlaysis
While exploring the data for relationships between variables, a linear dependance between Year and average Temperature change is found and a hypothesis is thus formulated as below:
As the year progresses, temperature around the world increases.
With Regression Analysis, the hypothesis is proved.
