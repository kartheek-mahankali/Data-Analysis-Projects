# Instacart

## Objective
Instacart is an online store that operating through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The objective of this project is to perform initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggests strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

## Context
The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and they are considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products.

## Key Questions
The Stakeholders would like to be able to answer the following key questions:
Questions
● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day
  are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times
  when there are fewer orders.
● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend
  the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use
  simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
  and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product
  orders.
● The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
  customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.
